# AI-Assisted Knowledge Quiz App

## 1. Project Setup & Demo

### Web:
Run `npm install && npm start` to launch locally. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Mobile:
N/A - This is a web-based React application.

### Demo:
Provide a screen recording or hosted link (for web). [Insert link or describe how to access demo]

## 2. Problem Understanding

The task is to build an AI-assisted knowledge quiz application where users can select topics, take quizzes generated by AI, and create custom quizzes. The app should be responsive, with a sidebar for navigation, and support for phone screens with a toggleable sidebar.

Assumptions made:
- The app uses OpenAI API for quiz generation and feedback.
- Custom quizzes are stored in local state (not persisted).
- The app is built with React and CSS for styling.
- Responsive design prioritizes mobile usability.

## 3. AI Prompts & Iterations

### Initial Prompts:
- For quiz generation: "Generate a quiz with 5 multiple-choice questions on [topic]. Each question should have 4 options and indicate the correct answer."
- For feedback: "Provide feedback on a quiz score of [score] out of [total] questions."

### Issues Faced:
- Initial prompts sometimes returned malformed JSON, requiring parsing and error handling.
- Feedback prompts needed refinement for more personalized responses.

### Refined Prompts:
- Quiz generation: Enhanced with retry logic and JSON validation.
- Feedback: Adjusted to provide encouraging messages based on performance.

## 4. Architecture & Code Structure

- `App.jsx`: Main component managing navigation between screens (topic selection, quiz, results, create quiz) and state (questions, answers, score, sidebar toggle).
- Separate render functions for each screen: `renderTopicScreen`, `renderQuizScreen`, `renderResultsScreen`, `renderCreateScreen`.
- `openai.js`: Handles AI calls for quiz generation and feedback, with error handling and retry logic.
- State management: React useState hooks for local state.
- Components: `Question` component for displaying quiz questions.

## 5. Screenshots / Screen Recording

Attach screenshots (web) or screen recording (mobile) covering all screens.

- Topic Selection Screen
- Quiz Screen
- Results Screen
- Create Quiz Screen
- Sidebar Toggle on Mobile

## 6. Known Issues / Improvements

### Bugs/Limitations:
- Custom quizzes are not persisted across sessions (stored in state only).
- No validation for custom quiz inputs beyond basic checks.
- Sidebar toggle animation could be smoother.

### Improvements with More Time:
- Add local storage or backend for quiz persistence.
- Implement user authentication and quiz sharing.
- Enhance UI with animations and better error messages.
- Add more topics and quiz difficulty levels.

## 7. Bonus Work

- Added responsive design for phone screens with full-height sidebar toggle.
- Implemented custom quiz creation feature.
- Added progress bar and navigation controls in quiz.
- Styled with a dark theme consistent with the original design.
